Project report requirements:

Your final deliverable will be a paper describing your project. 
In the paper you will discuss your project in detail, situate it in the context of others' work, 
and evaluate your progress as a team and as individuals. 
The  paper  should  be  5-7  pages  long  (this  length  requirement  should  include results).  
If your project involves building a system, 
you should clearly state your goals for the system, 
give an overview of its architecture, 
and describe in some detail the algorithms selected to implement the MLmodules of the system. 
You should also cite relevant research and other articles to situate your project in the broader 
context of work in this general area. In assessing your system, you will need to clearly articulate 
exactly what you are evaluating, how you have gone about performing evaluation, and how it stacks up. 
For instance, say you've implemented a system that "reads" long articles and generates one-paragraph 
summaries of them. 
What inputs can your system handle? 
What does it produce? 
Have you built in any special domain knowledge that restricts the topic of the articles? 
Does your system identify the most relevant information? Does it organize it well in terms of the flow of language? 
Is it grammatically correct? 
What are the limitations of your system? 
If your project includes an empirical comparison of algorithms, you should clearly specify what you are  comparing,  
what  you  are  measuring,  
the  methodology  you  developed  for  the  empirical investigation, 
and any data sets or existing code you used as part of the work. 
You should discuss --critically and analytically --the results of the investigation.
